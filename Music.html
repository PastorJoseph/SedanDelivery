    <p class="text-light fs-2">
I remember gray skies falling <br> and the miles stretched out between each side of town <br>
I had no sense of direction, just the feeling I was slowly sinking down <br>
It was midnight in the city, I can’t tell you but I knew what had begun <br>
I was thinking I was crazy for not doing what I knew I should have done <br><br>

I stood watching, remembering, with no chance to explain <br>

My time was ending on a January morning in the rain <br><br>

Have you ever been so sure you could not fall you never bothered to look down? <br>
And then sure enough you stumbled<br> and the next thing you knew, you were on the ground <br>
I threw away so much I never even knew I even had to lose <br>
I learned too late you’d never wait around for me to get things straight and choose <br><br>

I stood watching, remembering, with no chance to explain <br>

My time was ending on a January morning in the rain <br><br>

    <p class="text-light fs-2">
      She loaded up the kids in an old Impala station wagon <br>
Picture books, and toys won at the district fair<br>
She took a lot of pain in her life<br>
But not as much as she took in the past eight years<br>
Oh, there were so many tears<br>
<br><br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
<br><br>
He came home from work, walked into an empty house<br>
Well, there was still some furniture<br>
But no one else was there<br>
Sat down on the sofa<br>
Said, “My god, what has she done to me?”<br>
“Oh lord, what has she done?”<br>
<br><br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
She just got up and walked right out the door<br><br>





He sat down and said to himself<br>
“Well how could she do this to me?”<br>
Like most people do when they won’t admit they’re wrong<br>
Now the kids are at her mother’s<br>
And she’s staying with her sister<br>
And she won’t go back<br>
No she won’t go back this time<br>
<br><br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore<br>
When pain ain’t worth the pleasure any more<br>
You just get up and walk right out the door.<br>

You shake me ‘til I can’t stand up<br>
I know it’s really my own fault<br>
But how was I to know I couldn’t stop?<br>
<br><br>
And now I’m falling hard for every line<br>
Yes, I’m falling further all the time<br>

But you know how I need you<br>
So you push me til I can’t stand up<br>

      Moments come and then they’re gone <br>
Wheels turning round and round and round<br>
There is no end<br>
<br><br>
You can try and stop the flow<br>
caught up in the undertow<br>
It’s dragging you away my friend<br>
<br><br>
I want to tell you<br>
I want to talk to you<br>
I want to tell you<br>
Tell you<br>
Everything<br>
<br><br>
Once you thought you knew the song<br>
Until you found you had it wrong<br>
So badly out of tune<br>

I want to tell you<br>
I want to talk to you<br>
I want to tell you<br>
Tell you<br>

    <p class="text-light fs-2">
      She pulls back the shades <br>
And smiles at me<br>
One look tells me all I need to know<br>
And then she asks me why I need her so<br>

And I say:<br><br>
“Ain’t no secret, baby”<br>
“Ain’t no reason that is true”<br>
“I love you like I do because I do”<br>
<br><br>
She walks in the room<br>
Lovely and sublime<br>
Sweet and white gardenia in her hair<br>
And then she asks for reasons I should care<br>
<br><br>
And I say:<br>
“Ain’t no secret, baby”<br>
“Ain’t no reason that is true”<br>
“I love you like I do because I do”<br><br>

    <p class="text-light fs-2">
      For the sad old blue-eyed man who stayed alive <br>
Who tried and tried and tried to say goodbye<br>
Spent his years in a spiral suicide<br>
And he lost all hope when his best friend finally died<br>
<br><br>
Ah, for years his music gave me a reason<br>
Long after it had ceased to please him<br>
Hope I die before I get too old<br>
Or at least before my dreams have all been sold<br>
<br><br>
Oh, there’s nothing to believe in any more<br>
All my faith is gone, been swept right out the door<br>
The teenage wasteland’s claimed another soul<br>
There’s nothing to believe in anymore<br>
<br><br>
But maybe ah yeah it’s better anyway<br>
Cos compromise is the order of the day<br>
Still I remember leaping around the room<br>
At seventeen and growing old too soon<br>
<br><br>
Oh, there’s nothing to believe in any more<br>
All my faith is gone, been swept right out the door<br>
The teenage wasteland’s claimed another soul<br>
There’s nothing to believe in anymore<br>

<h2 class="text-light text-center my-5">Pain Ain't Worth The Peeasure</h2>
    <p class="text-light fs-2">
      She loaded up the kids in an old Impala station wagon
      Picture books, and toys won at the district fair
      She took a lot of pain in her life
      But not as much as she took in the past eight years
      Oh, there were so many tears
      
      The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore
      The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore
      
      He came home from work, walked into an empty house
      Well, there was still some furniture
      But no one else was there
      Sat down on the sofa
      Said, “My god, what has she done to me?”
      “Oh lord, what has she done?”
      
      The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore
      She just got up and walked right out the door
      
      Guitar solo
      
      The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore
      The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore
      
      He sat down and said to himself
      “Well how could she do this to me?”
      Like most people do when they won’t admit they’re wrong
      Now the kids are at her mother’s
      And she’s staying with her sister
      And she won’t go back
      No she won’t go back this time
      
      The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore
      The pain ain’t worth the pleasure anymore
      When pain ain’t worth the pleasure any more
      You just get up and walk right out the door.
